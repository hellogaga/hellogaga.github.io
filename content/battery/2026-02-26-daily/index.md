## Key Observations

1. **0 charge/discharge cycle(s) completed** today
2. **Energy throughput**: 0 kWh charged, 0 kWh discharged (round-trip: 0.0%)
3. **Ancillary service revenue**: 30226.26 SEK
4. **SoC range**: 50.0% – 50.0%

## Notes

This report was automatically generated by the **zexergy-opt** optimisation engine.

The optimizer uses a **back-tracking method** (rolling 48-hour horizon with look-ahead) to determine
the optimal hourly scheduling of the battery. By solving a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) over
two consecutive days and retaining only the first 24 hours, the algorithm avoids short-sighted
end-of-day effects and produces a globally informed dispatch plan. This back-tracking approach
ensures that decisions made today account for anticipated market conditions tomorrow, leading
to more robust charge/discharge and ancillary service participation schedules.
