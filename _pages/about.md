I am working as an energy system analyst in the field of district heating. I am constantly curious about:
* Python
* Data Science
* Machine Learning
* IoT

I would like to see how to use these techniques in a relatively old industry. I would like to use this place to record what I have learned and came across. If you think what I posted here interests you, do not hesitate to contact me. We can have a discussion.
