## What is SCRCPY
Today I found an very good package [SCRCPY](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy). This great tool enables mirroring and control of an android device from Desktop. This package is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS. It is completely free. This package is very helpful for people who would not like switching between devices. You can do everything just on the desktop! 

## Installation
1. Enable the USB debugging in the android device. I am using oneplue 7 pro. This can be done through the following steps.  About the phone >> click the "Version Nr" for several times. This will enable the developer mode. >> go to "system / developer options" and enable USB debugging. <br>

2. Install SCRCPY in the Linux PC. I am using the Ubuntu 20.04 and the default version of SCRCPY will be 1.12, which is a bit of out dated. 

3.
